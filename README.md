```

# Why this repo Ôºü

when I have the following sentence. ( from [How Are Function Components Different from Classes?](https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/))

```
Maybe you‚Äôve heard one of them is better for performance. Which one? Many of such benchmarks are flawed so I‚Äôd be careful drawing conclusions from them.
```
I don't want to translate all the text first and I'd like to translate segment by segment. Especially in an article, the whole translation may not work well.

In the existing library, if I want to translate multi-segment text, I have to request multiple times.(like [google-translate-api](https://github.com/matheuss/google-translate-api))

So I have to use the new api to implement, so the `translate-google-api` is born.

# Usage

Single segment
```javascript
import translate from 'translate-google-api';
const result = await translate(`I'm fine.`, {
  tld: "cn",
  to: "vi",
});
// ["T√¥i ·ªïn."]


```

Multi-segment text
```javascript
import translate from 'translate-google-api';

const result = await translate([`I'm fine.`, `I'm ok.`], {
  tld: "cn",
  to: "vi",
});
["Ch√†o","B·∫°n kh·ªèe kh√¥ng?","T√¥i ·ªïn."]

```

Proxy

proxy-config [https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config)
```javascript
const result = await translate([`I'm fine. And you?`,`I'm ok.`], {
  tld: "cn",
  to: "vi",
  proxy: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 9000,
    auth: {
      username: 'mikeymike',
      password: 'rapunz3l'
    }
  }
});
```
